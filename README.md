# Hi :wave: I'm Sarah
I love solving problems and making things. I don't mind what language or framework I use to do that and I love to learn. Most of my experience is with C#, .Net, Javascript/Typescript, Vue & React. I love working with cloud platforms. Most of my experience is in Azure, but I've used AWS a bit here and there.

## :brain: Questions currently taking up space in my brain...
- What makes a workplace culture a good one to be an engineer in?
- How can we open doors to people who want to get into tech, regardless of their background?
- What's a good interview process for an engineer that also yields useful information to the company doing the interview?
